<h1>My sketchbook</h1>
<p>I took a sketchbook around the world with me, here are a few of the drawings.</p>

 <TR> <TD><img src="neworleans.jpg"><BR> 
The buildings of New Orleans are created with wooden slats and invoke memories of the plantations.<br></TD>
<TD><img src="central_park.jpg"><BR>
Amazingly, Central Park is a beautiful, peaceful sanctuary in the middle of New York. You can also see where John Lennon once lived and where he was assassinated.<br> </TD></TR>

<TR><TD><img src="bryson_can.jpg"><BR> 
I love the textures of the surrounding rocks and find them a challenge to draw<br></TD>
<TD><img src="govinda.jpg"><BR> 
We waited ages at this Hare Krishna vegetarian cafe in Arequipa, Peru for a simple sandwich, at least we were entertained by a group of musicians.<br></TR></TD>

<TR><TD><img src="santa_catalina.jpg"><BR> 
Santacatalina nunnery, again in Arequipa. This had the peaceful feeling of deserted but timeless place enticing you to just sit and 'be' for hours. I loved sitting here and drawing it.<br></TD> 
<TD><img src="misty_peru.jpg"><BR> 
Arequipa is overlooked by this mountain called 'Misty'. We watched the sunset here and the lamps come on. There was an optimistic old lady trying to sell us pop but we didn't buy any, I suppose she'll try again the next day.<br></TD></TR>

The best milkshake in New Zealand</td> 
<td><img src="lighthouse.jpg"><BR>
